# Bank_Marketing_Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict customer responses to a bank's marketing campaigns. By leveraging machine learning and data analysis techniques, we identify key factors influencing a customer's decision to subscribe to a term deposit. 

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is derived from a bank's direct marketing campaign. It contains customer demographic details, campaign interactions, and economic indicators. The target variable is whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit (yes or no).

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
- Clean and preprocess the data for optimal machine learning performance.
- Train classification models to predict customer subscription.
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
- Modeling: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and other ML models
- Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked for missing values and handled inconsistencies.
- Visualized relationships between customer attributes and responses.
- Analyzed feature importance using correlation heatmaps and statistical methods.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled categorical and numerical features.
- Standardized/normalized numerical data for better model performance.
- Used encoding techniques for categorical variables.

## Model Training & Evaluation
- Implemented multiple classification models.
- Measured model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Results & Insights
- Identified key factors influencing customer responses.
- Provided insights to improve marketing strategies.
- Achieved an optimized model with high predictive accuracy.
